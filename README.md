                                               Rockin' Roller! 

My project is a simple bookings page for the Monkee's band.
The page is a single scrolling html page utilising bootstrap to maximise its user experience and ease of use.
The goal of the project was to make it as easy as possible from arrival to book or contact the band, with some screening process for the band.



<h2>UX</h2>
This Website is targeted at Two key demographics, Fans looking to book,  the business owner (bar/hotel/sportsclub/corporate) looking for a musical act for a particular event/weekly slot (if they can afford the Monkee's).
The purpose of the page is to make it as simple and quick to make a booking/call the band in order to book it. This is not a dedicated fan page, as it lacks a community aspect.
It is a direct bookings page with the end goal of increasing the amount of inquiries the band receieves and inturn increasing their bookings.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:


As a small business, I want to book a band for an event/weekly entertainment slot, so that i can increase footfall within my business, more people raises the liklely gross money taken in.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Fearure 1 -
Navigation Bar -  allows all users to quickly navigate to each section of the page.

Feature 2 - 
Bookings Form - this allows users to begin correspondence with the band, let the band know in advance the type of event and give contact information to reply at the Band's discretion.
This allows the user to quickly enquire and the band to screen any queries they would rathe not undertake.

Feature 3-
The Vault -  The vault allows users browse photos,videos and links to the bands social media pages. 
This feature utilises a bootstrap carousel to showcase the bands highlights over their careers.

Feature 4 - 
Contact Section - a clear section providing users with contact information including Phone and email contact details.

Features To implement
Feature 1 - Adding simple hover animations using Java script.
Due to time constraint and my own bugging out when attempting implementations the site lacks many necessary java script animations to increase the UX on the page. 
This is an easy way to make the website have a polished finish


<h2>Extra Feature Ideas</h2>
Feature 1 - 
A community section to allow past users to discuss/rate their experience both with the band and the site itself. 
By creating a community it inturn lowers churn rates increasing the likelyhood of return business.

Feature 2 -  
A simple E-commerce section selling Albums/merchandise for the band. After 50 years in the business touring may become tiresome but online shop would definitely increase gross profits for the band.



<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>

Bootstrap;
The project utilised Bootstrap for navigation bars and the Carousel slideshow for the maximum user experience and as this project has a mobile first
approach making it highly applicable.

JQuery
This technology was utilised to solve the carousel issue of being unable to cycle the photos.

<h2>Deployment</h2>

The Deployment i utilised was GitHub Pages as it is the medium i am most familiar with and trust to host such an important page.


<h2>Credits</h2>

The Photos used were obtained from the code institute or google image search, the googled images are marked for re-use.

The text and content was all created by myself but i can gladly add/edit/adapt anything to better tailor it to the Band's liking.

Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project from the code institute, i believe whole heartedly that they have my best interest in mind and i personally
am not satisfied with the standard of this work. It was excellent to be put in this position as it allowed me work out many of the issues i had in modules coming up.
It gave me invaluable first hand experience on how to plan and execute a webpage in it's entirety (as far as i know at this moment!)
